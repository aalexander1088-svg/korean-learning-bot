### Adding New Sources

You can easily add new news sources by modifying the `NewsScraper` class in `src/news-scraper.ts`:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Your News Site',
  url: 'https://yournewsite.com',
  selectors: {
    headline: 'h2 a, h3 a',
    link: 'a',
    container: 'article'
  },
  maxHeadlines: 5
}
```

### Customizing Email Content

Modify the email templates in `src/news-email-bot.ts` to customize the appearance and content of your news digests.

## Troubleshooting

### Email Issues
- Ensure you're using an app password for Gmail (not your regular password)
- Check that your email credentials are correct in `.env`
- Verify SMTP settings match your email provider

### Scraping Issues
- Some websites may block automated requests
- Check if the website structure has changed (selectors may need updating)
- The bot includes delays between requests to be respectful

### Build Issues
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check TypeScript compilation with `npm run build`

## Examples

```bash
# Send news digest immediately
npm run news-bot

# Send only Korea Times headlines
npm run news-bot -- --source "Korea Times"

# Show all available sources
npm run news-bot -- --sources

# Start scheduler with news bot
npm run schedule

# Test news bot with scheduler
npm run schedule -- --news
```
